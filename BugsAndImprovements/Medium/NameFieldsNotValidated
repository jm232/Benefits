Fields First Name and Last Name are not validated

Fields First Name and Last Name in "Add Employee" and "Edit Employee" dialog are not validated properly.
Although max string value do not allow creation of employee, there is no information for end user on UI side


How to reproduce:

Login to Benefits UI
Click on "Add Employee" button
Fill in to First Name and Last Name more than maxLength value > 50, and click on "Add" button
