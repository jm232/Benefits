Field Dependents is not validated

Field "Dependents" for "Add Employee" and "Edit Employee" dialog is not validated properly.

There is no frontend validation and no warning for end user who is trying to put non int value, employee is not created but validation should be placed.

How to reproduce:

Login to Benefits UI
Click on "Add Employee" button
Fill in to Dependents string value or decimal value
