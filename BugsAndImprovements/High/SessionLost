UI Session expires and user is still logged in

When session of UI is expired due to inactivity of user, then user is still logged in, even any actions (add,edit,delete) are not successful
So user should be automatically logged out, when session expires.

Example from server: 
{
    "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.1",
    "title": "Unauthorized",
    "status": 401,
    "traceId": "0HN9SKKQ7PKV5"
}

How to reproduce:

Login to UI
Wait 10 minutes and then try to add new employee
